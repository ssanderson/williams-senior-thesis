Title: Generalizing Nondeterminism for Computational Machines over Algebraic Structures

We present an introduction to the BSS Machine model of complexity
theory, which generalizes the classical Turing Machine model by
allowing for computation over uncountably infinite algebraic
structures.  Building on the BSS model, we present a novel
generalization of the complexity class NP and give some results
relating our class to other algebraic characterizations of NP.
