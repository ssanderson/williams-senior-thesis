What is Complexity Theory:
    - We want to mathematically characterize 
      the intrinsic difficulty of solving problems.
    - Requires model of computation
        - (What can be computed?)
    - Requires a notion of resources consumed in computation
        - (How expensive is a computation?)
(3:00)

Classical Complexity Theory:
    - Machine Model = Turing Machine
    - Resources vary
        - Time
        - Space
        - We're going to focus on time
(4:00)

Turing Machines: (Re-use Miller talk slides?)
    - Infinite 1-way tape w/ symbols
    - Tape head on a cell
    - Set of states
    - Transition function from (symbol, state) -> (symbol, state, direction)
(5:00)

Turing Machine Example (inverter):
    - Pretty picture
(5:30)

Motivating BSS Model (TM Limitations):
    - Turing Machines inherently tied to finite symbolic representation of data.
        - Picture of tape w/ cells
    - Complexity theory fundamentally understanding algorithms/iterative processes.
    - Math has lots of algorithms/iterative processes.
    - Not all of them can be expressed in terms of finite symbols.
(6:30)

Motivating BSS Model (TM Limitations):
    - Example: Mandelbrot Set           
    - Pretty picture
    - We might want to know if some algorithm exists to determine membership.
    - Can't even ask the question using TM's.
(7:00)

Motivating BSS Model (Natural Generalization):
    - Some problems we talk about in Classical Theory naturally generalize to 
      non-integer domains.
    - Example: Subset Sum
    - Known to be hard in a precise in classical theory, but often discrete problems
      are harder than continuous problems. Perhaps less hard in the continuous case?
(8:30)

Motivating BSS Model (General Theorem -> Specific Theorem)
    - Sometimes best way to prove things about a special case is actually to
      prove a more general theorem.
